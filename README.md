# Data Science Portfolio
This is a repository containing projects that I worked in order to hone my skills on python, data analysis and machine learning. The majority of these projects are presented in the form of iPython notebooks. Some projects may be subject to future updates.

Currently all projects are in english.

##  Personal Projects

* ### Data Analysis
  
  * [Moneyball](https://github.com/diogolbar/portfolio/tree/main/Moneyball): This project is a simple exploratory data analysis and feature engineering to try to find replacement players for a team (Oakland Athletics) who just recently lost three key players. This is a capstone project from [Jose Portila's](https://www.udemy.com/course/data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp-with-r/) course adapted for python and inspired by the Moneyball book and movie. [Jupyter Notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/diogolbar/portfolio/blob/main/Moneyball/Moneyball.ipynb)

* ### Machine Learning
  
  * Fraud Detection: This project uses data from the IEEE Fraud Detection Challenge. Here a dataset with 400+ features is explored in order to detect and classify frauds from customers' purchases.

  * [Image Classifier](https://github.com/diogolbar/image-classifier): In this project a basic neural network architecture is used to distinguish between Chihuahuas and Muffins. [Jupyter Notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/diogolbar/image-classifier/blob/main/Chihuahua-Muffin.ipynb)
  
* ### End-to-End
  
  * [Demand Forecast](https://github.com/diogolbar/store-sales-forecast): In this project a standard regression approach is used to forecast multiple time series for the next year sales for 10 stores and 50 items. Data used is available at Kaggle. [Jupyter Notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/diogolbar/store-sales-forecast/blob/main/DemandTimeSeries.ipynb)
