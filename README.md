# Data Science Portfolio
This is a repository containing projects that I worked in order to hone my skills on python, data analysis and machine learning. The majority of these projects are presented in the form of iPython notebooks.

Currently all projects are in english.

##  Personal Projects

* ### Data Analysis
  
  * [Moneyball](https://github.com/diogolbar/diogolbar.github.io/blob/main/Moneyball/Moneyball.ipynb): Exploratory data analysis to try to find replacement players for a team (Oakland Athletics) who just recently lost three key players. This is a capstone project from [Jose Portila's](https://www.udemy.com/course/data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp-with-r/) course adapted for python and inspired by the Moneyball book and movie.
